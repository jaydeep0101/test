Fast forward 12 years and we’re shipping to over 200 countries worldwide, and building a community who value our unique design, quality pieces, and responsible production. For me, the ultimate goal is to focus on leaving a positive mark on our communities and environment while creating pieces that enable our customers to express themselves how they want to.” <br><br> - CEO & Founder <br><br>Rana Mikdashi"}}},"order":["main","1642588133bc09fbec","1642588465d53a779c","16425888375ac8a403","1642590263e178b5fe","16425094672831f242"]}
